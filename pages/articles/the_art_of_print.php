	<p>You've seen them before: links that say 'click here for printer-friendly version' or words to that effect.
	Every time you follow one of those links, you load a separate document that presents exactly the same information
	with a different layout, and probably different markup.</p>
	<p>That means somebody (or a script) had to take the original document and convert it to a stripped-down version that's
	more suitable for print output. Maybe that somebody was even you.</p>

	<p>Common practice with the usage of print stylesheets is to remove anything except the content &mdash; menus, ads, buttons and backgrounds.
	But what if you want to print those? What if the whole reason for printing out the page was to capture that ad? &hellip;that I love the layout
	so much I want to frame it? A print stylesheet presumes to know exactly what it is that you want to print, yet the web page presents us with
	a host of ancillary information that we might also want to capture. The only way I can circumvent the print stylesheet is to hack it out &mdash;
	mess with the source and remove the stylesheet link.</p>
