# University Project

This website was created for my final year project at university.

I was an investigation in to the best practices of HTML and CSS and how to build
accessible websites. It took multiple designs from world-class web designers
which could then be switched to and used throughout the site.

The site also includes many articles about the basics of web development at the time.

Built using PHP.
